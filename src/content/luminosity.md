# Spoiler-free review - Luminosity

Luminosity is an extremely unique fanfiction series which embraces its strengths and abandons its weaknesses. It is the combination of the best parts of three works: Twilight (off which it is based), HPMOR, and surprisingly Game of Thrones. It executes well on its promise of introducing LessWrong-style utilitarianism into a world of supernatural romance. But we also get a gritty, gripping plot, with varied and believable characters. If that sounds like what you are looking for, I promise it is _exactly_ what you are looking for.

Twilight's strength is that it is fun. I read it as a kid, and its strength to me is as a fantasy series, not as a romance series. The characters make sense in-universe, the magic follows Sanderson's laws, and the plot happens to be driven by a romance. It got a lot of bad press because it isn't a very "literary" series. If you were to hit Twilight with your english literature textbook, it would be crushed. But if you suspend your disbelief and you get into the world of the characters, it is a good series.

Luminosity understands this and keeps the formula. We still get the fun exploration of supernatural powers. We still get great character relationships driven by the world and its events. But we get Rational Bella instead of Average Bella, and enjoy the myriad flow-on effects, including taking the supernatural romance of Twilight to interesting logical conclusions.

HPMOR teaches us philosophy and science through the familiar world of Harry Potter. As a nerd I love exploring science, logic and magic, and familiar characters using those to their advantage. Most fanfiction tries to improve the original story, but HPMOR also tries to improve you in real life! Concepts in philosophy and science are easy to explore in a supernatural world, which is really just another word for "thought experiment".

Luminosity does the same thing with the world of Twilight, and with more finesse. The concepts don't usually get explained, instead the characters live through them as we read. This leads to you really understanding those concepts. There are more unique intellectual moments and themes in the Luminosity series than in many other works, and the author does a great job of melding them into the story.

The series is not perfect - sometimes the characterizations are a bit off, especially in the middle of the first book. There is a slow patch in the middle of Radiance which you should definitely push through. A few times I lost track of the setting, due to characters moving around a lot and long sections of dialogue. But it really is a great work of fiction!

As a fanfiction reader, I should warn you about Luminosity's plot. You may not like that the characters do not always win. Tragedy is rare in fanfiction, because readers do not want it to happen. Luminosity embraces the fact that peoples actions have permanent consequences. The result of this is an extremely gripping story, where you know that anything can happen. And when the characters do succeed it feels even better!

Luminosity is a very good execution of a very niche idea which I found very enjoyable.
