<sergey-template name="title">DFPL: Democratic Funding Public License</sergey-template>
<sergey-template name="subtitle">A plan to fund open source software, tools for productivity, and other public goods &mdash; through a new style of copyright license.</sergey-template>

True public goods are almost always under-funded because everyone benefits equally, and the provider benefits less than the cost of the good.

There are two solutions to providing public goods:

  1. Coordinate to pay for the public good through a central entity. Ususally, we do this through a government. e.g. Most civil infrastructure, the transportation network.
  2. Make it not a public good, so as to incentivize the creation. Eg. DRM on digital content restricts access and allows a provider to earn money for their content that would otherwise be extremely cheap to copy and provide to everyone.
  
Open source software is a pure public good, and I and others argue it is underfunded. I propose a solution of type 2 to fund open source software.
