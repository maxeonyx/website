      <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
      <p>
        I see myself as a generalist, although I have particular experience in deep learning from my academic research, and full-stack web development from my previous employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role in most organizations is as an enabler, doing the necessary engineering to ensure the rest of the team moves forward at full speed. As a result I am particularly well suited to Research Engineering roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am motivated to apply because I want to improve the world via the development of AGI.
        Furthermore, I would like to contribute to solving the safety & alignment challenges that come as the
        technology becomes increasingly advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples of projects that excite me:
        <ul>
          <li>
            AI systems which reason using multi-modal but human-understandable intermediate formats. Intuitive visualizations enable both correctness and transparency. Here, I would be best suited to contribute to building the data processing pipeline, developing model training and evaluation tools, and solving scaling challenges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collecting and curating a dataset of human morality and moral reasoning. Advanced AI systems will need to distinguish between high and low quality moral reasoning, and will need to be evaluated on values spanning many cultures and languages. Some of this data exists, some does not. AI tools can themselves be used to accelerate this project. <br/>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my experience, I am a very fast learner, and can quickly begin contributing to any project that is aligned with my values.
